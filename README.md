# ActualCalc
An... actual calculator.

I use an ipad very often for work, little known fact: ipads don't have a built in calculator for some reason. 
The majority of calculators on the app store either don't do what I want or don't function like a sane calculator that can evaluate expressions.

Therefore...

### I Built My Own
This repo is for a website that functions as a PWA (progressive web app) primarily tested on IOS.
It can be installed by simply going to [this repo's website](https://umi-l.github.io/ActualCalc/), tapping the share icon then tapping "add to home screen".
From there it works just like any calculator app you'd imagine, only without advertisements (seriously who wants a calculator with ads?).

## Features
* This calculator uses math.js under the hood for the expression evaluation
* supports full multitasking using split view on IOS
* Has both a light and dark theme
* Is entirely cross platform (anything that supports a web browser)
* Is entirely open source (open code, not free as in freedom)
* Written in typescript & svelte
* Supports keyboard
* Dynamicly sized
* History
* No data collection of any sort
